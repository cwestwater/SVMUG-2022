# SVMUG-2022

Packer files used in demo at Scottish VMUG, September 2022

## Running the build

This will not work on your system as the variables such as vCenter, usernames, passwords, etc are for demo purposes only.

## Useable Repo

Please look at my repo [packer-vsphere-iso](https://github.com/cwestwater/packer-vsphere-iso) for code that you can use for building your own templates with Packer.
